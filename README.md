## Project Structure

### React

React it used to construct User Interface, rendering react components on the client-side, it is possible to render on the server side and send to the client using ReactDOMServer, but I've never used this object.

### json-server

To fetch data about dishes, comments, promotions, leaders and post a feedback to a server, we use json-server to set up a REST API for our application. Further, we use this server to deploy our application.

### Redux

Redux is used to handle state management in our application, is the data store in our client-side. To use react with redux, there's a package called react-redux, that provides Provider Container Component, to pass information as props to our application and connect method, so that we can export a component connected to Redux store in our app. It also provides hooks such as useSelector, useStore to interact with the store.

### Deployment

The application is deployed using json-server. Inside the public folder we put the static files, such as html, images, javascript and css files in there. A nice thing that I learned studying this project and reading create-react-app documentations, is that you can get the same result using [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/static-files.html) to serve static files.
